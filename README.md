# Enact

**An action firewall for AI agents.**

Enact sits between your AI agent and the outside world. Every action goes through a policy gate first. If it passes, Enact executes it and returns a signed receipt. If it doesn't, nothing happens.

```python
from enact import EnactClient
from enact.connectors.github import GitHubConnector
from enact.workflows.agent_pr_workflow import agent_pr_workflow
from enact.policies.git import no_push_to_main, require_branch_prefix

enact = EnactClient(
    systems={"github": GitHubConnector(token="...")},
    policies=[no_push_to_main, require_branch_prefix(prefix="agent/")],
    workflows=[agent_pr_workflow],
)

result, receipt = enact.run(
    workflow="agent_pr_workflow",
    actor_email="agent@company.com",
    payload={"repo": "owner/repo", "branch": "agent/my-feature"},
)
```

## How It Works

```

        ▼
┌───────────────────┐
│  Policy Gate      │  All policies run. Any failure = BLOCK.
│  (pure Python,    │  No LLMs. Versioned in Git. Testable.

## Three Things Enact Gives You

1. **Vetted action allowlist** — agents can only call workflows you explicitly register
2. **Deterministic policy engine** — plain Python functions, no LLMs, Git-versioned, fully testable
3. **Human-readable receipts** — every run records who, what, why, pass/fail, and what changed

---

## What Enact Can Do Right Now

### Policy enforcement
- Block agents from pushing directly to `main` or `master`
- Require branch names to match a prefix (e.g. `agent/`)
- Cap how many files an agent can touch per commit
- Restrict actions to a UTC time window (e.g. 2am–6am maintenance window), including midnight-crossing windows like 22:00–06:00
- Block contractors from writing to PII fields
- Require the actor to hold a specific role (`admin`, `engineer`, etc.)
- Prevent duplicate contacts from being created in HubSpot (live lookup before the workflow runs)
- Rate-limit how many tasks an agent creates per contact within a rolling time window

### GitHub operations (via `GitHubConnector`)
- Create a branch
- Open a pull request
- Create an issue
- Delete a branch
- Merge a pull request

Every method is allowlisted at construction time — `GitHubConnector(token=..., allowlist=["create_branch", "create_pr"])` means the connector will refuse to call any method not on the list, even if the workflow tries.

### Built-in workflows
- **`agent_pr_workflow`** — creates a feature branch then opens a PR; aborts cleanly if branch creation fails so you never get a PR pointing at a non-existent branch
- **`db_safe_insert`** — checks for a duplicate row before inserting; returns an explanatory failure instead of letting the database raise a constraint violation

### Receipts
Every run — pass or block — produces an HMAC-SHA256 signed JSON receipt written to `receipts/`. It captures: who ran what, the full payload, every policy result with its reason, the final decision, and a timestamp. `verify_signature()` lets you prove a receipt hasn't been tampered with after the fact.

### What each file does

| File | Job |
|------|-----|
| `models.py` | Defines data shapes. `WorkflowContext` (inputs), `PolicyResult` (one policy check), `ActionResult` (one workflow action), `Receipt` (full signed run record), `RunResult` (what the agent gets back). |
| `client.py` | The main entry point. `EnactClient.run()` builds context, runs policies, executes the workflow if PASS, writes the receipt, returns `RunResult`. |
| `policy.py` | Runs every registered policy against `WorkflowContext`. Returns `list[PolicyResult]`. Never bails early — always runs all checks. |
| `receipt.py` | Takes policy results + action results, builds a `Receipt`, signs it with HMAC-SHA256, writes it to `receipts/`. |
| `connectors/` | Thin wrappers around vendor SDKs. Each connector exposes named actions (`create_branch`, `insert_row`, etc.) that workflows call. |
| `workflows/` | Python functions that orchestrate connector actions. Each workflow step produces an `ActionResult`. |
| `policies/` | Built-in reusable policy functions (ships with `pip install enact`). Each takes a `WorkflowContext` and returns a `PolicyResult`. |

## Data Flow (in code)

```
enact.run(workflow="agent_pr_workflow", actor_email="agent@co.com", payload={"repo": "owner/repo", "branch": "agent/fix"})
  │
  ├─▶ WorkflowContext(workflow, actor_email, payload, systems)
  │
  ├─▶ policy_results = [
  │       PolicyResult(policy="no_push_to_main",      passed=True, reason="Branch is not main/master"),
  │       PolicyResult(policy="require_branch_prefix", passed=True, reason="Branch 'agent/fix' has required prefix"),
  │   ]
  │
  ├─▶ decision = PASS → execute workflow
  │
  ├─▶ actions_taken = [
  │       ActionResult(action="create_branch", system="github", success=True, output={"branch": "agent/fix"}),
  │       ActionResult(action="create_pr",     system="github", success=True, output={"pr_number": 42, "url": "..."}),
  │   ]
  │
  ├─▶ Receipt(run_id, workflow, actor_email, payload, policy_results,
  │           decision="PASS", actions_taken, timestamp, signature)
  │
  └─▶ RunResult(success=True, workflow="agent_pr_workflow", output={...})
