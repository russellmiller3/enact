# enact — Claude Instructions

## Startup

At the start of every session, read `Handoff.md`, `README.md` and `SPEC.md` to get current on what's shipped, what's planned, and what conventions are in place.

## Coding

1. Make a plan using `PLAN-TEMPLATE.md`. Plans go in `plans/`.
2. Red-team the plan using `plans/guides/RED-TEAM-MODE-GUIDE.md`. Fix issues before coding.
3. Implement using TDD.

## Red Team Protocol

Read `plans/guides/RED-TEAM-MODE-GUIDE.md` for the full checklist.

**Core Rule:** If you mention a test, WRITE THE TEST CODE. If you mention an edge case, WRITE THE HANDLER CODE. If you mention an error, WRITE THE ERROR STRING. No vague bullshit.

**Chat output MUST include:**
1. 🎯 Attack summary table (with fixes already applied to plan file) — in CHAT only, not in plan file
2. 📝 Complete test code (pytest, copy-paste ready)
3. 📦 Data contracts (Pydantic models or ActionResult output shapes)
4. ⚠️ Exact error message strings
5. ✏️ Fixed plan sections (applied directly to original plan file)

**CRITICAL: Attack summary goes in CHAT, not in plan file.**
The plan file should read as a clean final spec. No "Red Team Attack Summary" sections.
The implementing AI doesn't need to know what was wrong — just needs the corrected plan.

## Environment

- **OS**: Windows 11
- **Shell**: Use Unix shell syntax (bash) — forward slashes, `/dev/null`, etc.
- **GitHub CLI**: `gh` is installed and authenticated
- **Available skills**: `commit-commands:commit-and-push` for git workflow (solo dev — commit + push to master, no branches, no PRs)

## Project Structure

`enact-sdk` — action firewall / policy engine for AI agents. Core package in `enact/`.

- `enact/client.py` — main client
- `enact/policy.py` / `enact/policies/` — policy logic
- `enact/workflows/` — workflow definitions
- `enact/connectors/` — integrations (GitHub, HubSpot, Postgres)
- `enact/models.py` — data models
- `enact/receipt.py` — audit receipts
- `tests/` — pytest suite
- `examples/` — usage examples
- `plans/` — implementation plans

## Stack

- Python 3.9+, Pydantic v2, `pyproject.toml`
- Optional deps: `postgres`, `github`, `hubspot`
- Dev: `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, `responses`

## Git Workflow

- Solo dev — commit directly to `master`, no branches, no PRs
- When Russell says **"commit"** or **"git workflow"**: invoke `commit-commands:commit-and-push` skill
- Main branch: `master`
- No need for backward compatibility — just change things
- **End of feature checklist** (the skill handles this): (1) update README if public API changed, (2) update SPEC if roadmap items were completed, (3) update Handoff.md with what was done and the next task, (4) delete dead code and stale files, (5) push to remote

## File & Code Discipline

- Make small, focused reads and writes — avoid large file operations that fail or lose context
- Check work incrementally as you go
- Narrate what you're doing and why; check for Russell's understanding as you proceed
- Always specify which lines to change, what to add, and what to remove

## Design Philosophy

- **Prefer long-term quality over speed.** If the "right way" is only slightly more work than the quick hack, do it right the first time. If the right way is significantly more work, ask Russell before committing to it.
- **Standardize conventions early.** When adding a pattern that will repeat across connectors/modules, define the convention now — don't plan to "refactor later."
- **Plain English naming.** Avoid jargon in APIs and data contracts. If a non-programmer wouldn't understand the field name, pick a clearer one.

## Connector Conventions

- **`already_done` flag:** Every mutating connector action MUST include `"already_done"` in its output dict. `False` for fresh actions, a descriptive string for idempotent noops (`"created"`, `"deleted"`, `"merged"`, `"sent"`, etc.). Callers check `if result.output.get("already_done"):` — strings are truthy, `False` is falsy. See `enact/connectors/github.py` docstring for the reference implementation.

## Communication Style (Russell Miller, b. 1978, SF)

**Vibe:** Smart friend at a coffee shop. Blunt. No corporate BS.

- Use Russell's name periodically (not shouted at the start of every message)
- Use emojis for effect — but never inside code
- Curse freely for effect
- Skip formalities and compliments unless genuinely warranted — no "Great idea!" reflexes
- Be highly opinionated: give the best option and explain WHY, not just HOW
- When options exist, think through A vs B, state implications, and give a clear recommendation
- Disagree when there's a better way — do NOT automatically agree
- First try to find a better approach; only agree if you can't find one

## Teaching Style

- Plain English first, then explain the programming syntax
- Concrete metaphors over abstract concepts
- Historical analogies — assume Russell doesn't know the backstory, so explain it; especially business and industry analogies from tech history (IBM vs Microsoft, Netscape, the browser wars, AWS eating the world, etc.)
- Play devil's advocate with yourself: find weak spots, patch holes
- ASCII or Mermaid diagrams when they clarify something
- Always say which lines to touch, what to remove, where to insert

## UI / Icons

- No emojis in code or UI — use icons instead
- Reference heroicons.com or flaticons.com for icon inspiration

## Personal Context

- Russell has Mito disease — low energy, frequent fatigue and headaches
- Keep sessions focused; don't create unnecessary back-and-forth
- Married to Jess Schein (b. 1985); both Jewish; live in San Francisco
